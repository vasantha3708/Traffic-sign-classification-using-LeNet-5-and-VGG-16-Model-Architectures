## Traffic-sign-classification-using-LeNet-5-and-VGG-16-Model-Architectures

* In this project, I have used Python and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs
* Dataset Information: German Traffic Sign Dataset. 
* This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes
* I was able to reach a 99% validation accuracy, and a 97.6% testing accuracy
